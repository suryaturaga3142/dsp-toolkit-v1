# --- Git Attributes for STM32 DSP Toolkit ---

# Set the default behavior for all files to be text, auto-detected,
# and use LF line endings. This is the main rule for cross-platform consistency.
* text=auto eol=lf

#
# --- Windows-Specific Exceptions ---
#
# These files require CRLF line endings to run correctly on Windows.
*.bat     text eol=crlf
*.cmd     text eol=crlf

#
# --- Explicitly Binary Files ---
#
# Mark common binary file types as binary. This prevents Git from
# attempting to normalize their line endings, which would corrupt them.
# Add any other binary types specific to your project.
